Deque Functions
Push

Starting Phase
Starts out with head and tail both pointing at the first place in the circular buffer
If push_back
	move the tail to that place
Else push_front
	move the head to that point

Other times
Each ptr can be in any place in the array
If push_back
	move the tail to the right
	if tail == head
		realloc and continue
	if tail == capacity
		circle around to the beginning
Else push_front
	if head == tail
		realloc and continue
	if head == 0
		circle around to the beginning
	else
		move head to the left
		add thing to this place

Pop_back
Check if the circular buffer is empty
 if empty exit the function
 else
 	set value = NULL
